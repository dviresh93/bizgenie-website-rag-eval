      "reasoning": "The answer accurately states that based on the BizGenie website, no mobile app is explicitly mentioned for managing the AI receptionist service. It notes the website focuses on core features but does not specify a mobile app, and the \"Instant Setup\" feature suggests web-based management rather than mobile. The answer is factual and clear, but could be more complete by definitively stating BizGenie does not currently offer a mobile management app based on available information. Overall helpful but lacks a firm conclusion.",

    "question": "Can BizGenie translate calls into different languages in real-time?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided on the BizGenie website, their AI receptionist service offers multi-language support for over 50 languages and regional dialects. The website states:\n\n\"Multi-Language Support\nServe customers in their preferred language with support for 50+ languages and regional dialects.\"\n\nHowever, it does not specify if the AI can translate calls between languages in real-time. The multi-language support likely means the AI can communicate fluently in many languages, but real-time translation between the caller and call recipient is not explicitly mentioned as a feature.\n\nTo get a definitive answer on real-time translation capabilities, I would recommend contacting BizGenie directly via their website's \"Book a Demo\" option or by calling them at the listed phone number (425) 683-1214. They should be able to clarify the full scope of their multi-language and any potential real-time translation features.",
