This indicates the agents can be set up to handle common receptionist tasks according to your specifications.\n\nTo get more details on the extent of customization available, I would recommend contacting BizGenie directly.

The website states that BizGenie \"offers AI receptionist service for your business with 24/7 call handling, appointment scheduling, and customer support\" but does not specify if this is managed through a mobile application.\n\nWithout additional information directly confirming the existence of a mobile app, I do not have enough evidence to definitively say whether BizGenie offers a mobile app or not for managing their AI service. The website content retrieved focuses on describing the AI receptionist capabilities but does not go into the details of how customers access and manage the service.",

The website mentions that BizGenie offers \"24/7 call handling, appointment scheduling, and customer support\" (Source: https://bizgenieai.com/), but it does not specify if real-time language translation is a feature of their service.\n\nTo provide a definitive answer, I would recommend contacting BizGenie directly to inquire about their AI receptionist's language translation capabilities. They should be able to clarify if this is a service they currently offer or plan to offer in the future.",
