Close-up of a young man holding a smartphone with the Great Clips app open. He taps “Check in” with his thumb to instantly add his name to the waitlist at his local Great Clips salon. A split second later, he walks through the front doors of his local Great Clips Salon. He’s greeted by a Great Clips stylist. He smiles and mouths the words, “I’m here to check in.” The stylist returns the smile, checks him in, walks him back to her station and invites him to take a seat. She puts a smock on him, turns the chair toward the mirror and begins talking with him about the type of haircut he wants. She asks a few questions, he answers them, and she begins to cut his hair, starting with clippers. Then after wetting his hair with a spray bottle, she puts on the finishing touches using a scissor and comb. Once she’s done, she pulls out a mirror to show him the back of his hair. He smiles as he checks out his haircut, and runs his hands along the back of his head to feel the length. He nods approvingly. The location changes to the lobby, where he pays a great price for a great haircut, then he and the Great Clips stylist wave goodbye to each other.
